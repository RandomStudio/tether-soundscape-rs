# Tether Soundscape rs

A multi-layered audio sequencer, remote-controllable via Tether, to create soundscapes.

## Using ðŸ¦€ Rust because:
- Minimal memory/CPU footprint for high performance
- Cross-platform but without any need to install browser, use Electron, etc.
- Visualisation via Nannou
- Great way to learn about low-level audio sample/buffer control, multi-threading in Rust (Nannou always uses separate "realtime" thread for audio)

## Remote control

All Instructions Message are expected to be received on the topic `+/+/instructions`

An Instruction Message has the following fields:
- `instructionType` (required): one of the following strings: "hit", "add", "remove", "scene"
- `clipNames` (required): an array of one or more string names for the clips
- `fadeDuration` (optional): an integer value for milliseconds to fade in or out (context-dependent)

Unlike with the [original](https://github.com/RandomStudio/tether-soundscape) we do not include a "silenceAll" instruction type because this requires making `clipNames` optional when this is only applicable to a single case. An empty scene `clipNames: []` is equivalent for now.

### Examples

Single clip hit:
```
tether-send --host 127.0.0.1 --topic dummy/dummy/instructions --message \{\"instructionType\":\"hit\"\,\"clipNames\":\[\"frog\"\]\}
```

Multiple clip hits:
```
tether-send --host 127.0.0.1 --topic dummy/dummy/instructions --message \{\"instructionType\":\"hit\"\,\"clipNames\":\[\"frog\"\,\"squirrel\"]\}
```

Scene with two clips:
```
tether-send --host 127.0.0.1 --topic dummy/dummy/instructions --message \{\"instructionType\":\"scene\",\"clipNames\":\[\"frog\"\,\"squirrel\"]\}
```

Remove single clip
```
tether-send --host 127.0.0.1 --topic dummy/dummy/instructions --message \{\"instructionType\":\"remove\",\"clipNames\":\[\"frog\"\]\}
```

Add single clip, custom fade duration
```
tether-send --host 127.0.0.1 --topic dummy/dummy/instructions --message \{\"instructionType\":\"add\",\"clipNames\":\[\"squirrel2\"\],\"fadeDuration\":5000\}
```

Scene with zero clips (silence all), custom fade duration:
```
tether-send --host 127.0.0.1 --topic dummy/dummy/instructions --message \{\"instructionType\":\"scene\"\,\"clipNames\":\[\],\"fadeDuration\":500\}
```


## TODO:
- [ ] Demonstrate running (headless) on Raspberry Pi
- [x] Apply "loop" as well as trigger/hit/once-off functions
- [x] Allow clips to be stopped/removed while playing (without stopping whole stream)
- [x] Allow starting/fixed "maximum" volume per clip to be applied
- [x] Apply fade in/out volume controls
- [x] Draw clip progress and volume
- [x] Allow "scenes" to be triggered (with transition)
- [ ] Make use of tempo, quantisation for timing
- [x] Env logging, CLI params
- [ ] Low/no graphics mode
- [x] Add Tether remote control commands, as per API in [original](https://github.com/RandomStudio/tether-soundscape)
- [ ] Separate CLIP and STREAM sample rates are currently a problem - might need a separate Reader (and thread!) for each clip if sample rates are allowed to differ
- [ ] Optionally connect to [Ableton link](https://docs.rs/ableton-link/latest/ableton_link/)
- [ ] Possibly distribute radius by "index" not duration
- [ ] Allow "instructions" to be subscribed to with a specified group (optional), so `+/someGroup/instructions` rather than the default `+/+/instructions`
